• Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds) — never stored or logged in plaintext
• Root passwords are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with per-instance IVs
• Password reset tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes — the plaintext token only ever exists in the reset email link
• All data queries are scoped to your user ID — cross-user data access requires admin role
• Session cookies are JWT-signed with a secret key, httpOnly, and secure
• HTTPS is enforced on all production endpoints

No system is completely secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication on any email account associated with SovereignML.`,

• Backup snapshots may retain data for up to 14 days before permanent deletion
